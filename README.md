# JavaScript Programming Assignments

This repository contains JavaScript programs that demonstrate different concepts and features. Each program focuses on a specific task and includes the necessary code to accomplish it. Below is a brief description of each assignment:

1. **Reverse String**
   - Description: This program uses the `setTimeout()` function to reverse a given string after a delay of 2 seconds. The input string is stored in the variable `input`, and the program implements a 2-second delay before reversing the string. The reversed string is then printed as output.
   - File: [reverse-string.js](reverse-string.js)

2. **Random Number Generator with Delay and Progress Indication**
   - Description: The goal of this program is to generate a random number after a delay of 3 seconds. The program displays a message every second indicating the time remaining until the random number is generated. Once generated, the program outputs the generated number.
   - File: [random-number-generator.js](random-number-generator.js)

3. **Store's Inventory Feature**
   - Description: This program converts prices of items in a store's inventory from US Dollars to Indian Rupees using an exchange rate of 1 USD to 80 INR. The program uses the `map` higher-order function to create a new object with the converted prices in Rupees.
   - File: [store-inventory.js](store-inventory.js)

4. **Filtering and Capitalizing: Books Published After 2010 with Author Names**
   - Description: The program takes a list of books, including their authors and publication years as input. It filters out all books that were published before 2010 and creates a new array with the remaining books. Additionally, it capitalizes the author names in the new array.
   - File: [filtering-and-capitalizing-books.js](filtering-and-capitalizing-books.js)

5. **URL Validation**
   - Description: This program uses a regular expression to match valid URLs. Valid URLs should start with either `http://` or `https://`, followed by one or more letters, digits, or special characters, followed by a dot, and ending with one or more letters. The program prints a message indicating whether the input matches the URL format or not.
   - File: [url-validation.js](url-validation.js)

6. **LinkedIn Profile URL Validator**
   - Description: This program validates LinkedIn profile URLs to ensure they are correctly formatted and contain only valid characters. Valid LinkedIn profile URLs should start with `https://www.linkedin.com/in/`, followed by a combination of one or more letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens, and end with a letter or digit. The program uses a regular expression to match valid LinkedIn profile URLs and provides clear output messages indicating whether each input is a valid LinkedIn profile URL or not.
   - File: [linkedin-url-validator.js](linkedin-url-validator.js)
